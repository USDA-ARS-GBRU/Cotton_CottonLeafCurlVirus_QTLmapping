# Scripts for Analysis of Cotton Leaf Curl Virus QTL mapping

This project contains the R scripts use in the Cotton Leaf Curl Virus paper.  These include selecting subsets of the Final Reports generated from the **SNP array**, creating JoinMap .loc files from the filtered marker sets, and translating Final Reports into IUPAC format.  Go to each script's folder for more details on the scripts and tutorials on how to run.

For easier use, a shiny app was developed encasing each of these scripts.  Further notes are in the Shiny folder.

**SIMPLE NOTES TO RUN**

These are the scripts I developed for ease of use when analyzing multiple populations for QTLs.  For the anaylses in the paper, the R scripts were used for each of the populations.  I developed them this way because we did not have access to the actual parents of the crosses, only representatives of the line.  For this reason, I needed to look more closely at what markers I was filtering and for what reasons.  Later on, the scripts were condensed into a shiny app for use in future projects.
